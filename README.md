## Status

This project is considered concluded, although there's a lot of space for improvement (the code is not the best and the technologies used are outdated).

## License

The project is released under the GNU Affero General Public License v3.0 which allows you to freely reuse this code with some conditions that maybe be annoying in case you have a commercial project (open sourcing the code). In that case, feel free to reach me out to see what we can do about it.
